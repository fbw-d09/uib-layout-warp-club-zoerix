![reference image](./assets/reference.png)

#### Instructions

> - Use the _Jura_ font from **Google Fonts** for the entire page
> - Don't worry about responsivity at the moment - just concentrate on the desktop layout
> - Give your parent container of the vertically split section the class `.warp-club`
> - Use the classes `.column1` and `.column2` for the two parts of the vertically split section
> - All images are located in the **assets** folder
> - Add appropriate `:hover` effects on the links
> - Get as close to 'pixel perfect' as possible :)
